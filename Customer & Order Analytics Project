#Querying a database with multiple tables to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM JanSales

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum FROM customers

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT Product, MIN(price)

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
